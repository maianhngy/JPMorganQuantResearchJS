## **Quantitative Research Job Simulation â€“ Python, Data Analysis & Quantitative Finance**  

### **Overview**  
This repository contains my work on the JPMorgan Quantitative Research Job Simulation, focusing on key areas of quantitative finance, data analysis, and risk assessment. The project applies advanced analytical techniques to financial datasets, including price forecasting, derivative pricing, credit risk modeling, and FICO score segmentation.  

### **Key Tasks :**  

- **Price Analysis:** Conducted a comprehensive analysis of historical price trends in commodity markets, leveraging statistical and machine learning techniques for predictive modeling.  
- **Derivative Pricing:** Developed a prototype model to value commodity storage contracts, incorporating stochastic modeling and financial derivatives pricing methodologies.  
- **Credit Risk Modeling:** Designed a predictive model to assess borrower default probabilities, utilizing credit risk analytics and probabilistic modeling.  
- **FICO Score Segmentation:** Implemented dynamic programming techniques to categorize FICO scores, enhancing risk assessment and creditworthiness evaluation.  

This project showcases expertise in Python programming, quantitative analysis, and financial modeling, reflecting the critical skills required in modern quantitative finance roles.
